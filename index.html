    <p>
Singapore is well established as one of the most crucial business and economic hub in Asia .  The republic offers a great mix of business opportunities and creature comforts such as a high degree of personal safety, good public infrastructure and air connectivity to 250 cities worldwide.
<br><br>
It not surprising that the permanent resident (and eventually citizenship status) is coveted by many professionals and investors who have been working in Singapore and want to stay in the city-state for a longer period.
<br><br>
With an ageing population and low birth rate, the government has committed to grant PR status to 30,000 eligible candidates annually.  But applying for a PR can be a traumatic and painful experience involving a great deal of uncertainty, as evidenced by the sentiments shown in the news and public forums.  There is also a significant number of companies that offer services simply to help on the PR application process.  But the process is convoluted and opaque.  Singapore is also notoriously secretive on the factors of the selection process, the exact criteria is never revealed to the public.  The ICA (Immigration Checkpoint Authority) does not disclose the reason for rejection, but merely sends a generic letter to inform.  For years, the public has been continuously speculating from anecdotal information.  There had been no formal data analysis on this topic to date.
<br><br>
Leveraging on Singaporeâ€™s Smart Nation Open Data initiative, I will take advantage of the publicly available data (and request for ones that are not yet available) to try to extrapolate the factors that influence the permanent residence success rate.
